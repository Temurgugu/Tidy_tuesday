This site explores two datasets provided by the [National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/). In the first interactive plot, you will see the the percent of ethnic groups population which attained a degree in High School or College between 1980-2016. In the second interactive graph, you will see the number of students enrolled in Historically Black Colleges and Universities between 1976-2015.

This site was build as submission to [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) week 06 2021. You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/avrodrigues/Tidy_tuesday/tree/main/2021/week06).
